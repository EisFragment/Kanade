- I need to study  [[Mecánica]], [[Cálculo]], [[Álgebra y Trigonometría]] and [[Geometría Analítica]] before [[2025-01-06]]. I'm going to learn what I lack to make goals and tasks to study with purpose. I don't want to fail. I don't want to be left behind, but I won't cry or shift the blame to others. I'm going to start again. I'm going to take control of my life and do what I like, and live productively, achieving goals. But first, I need to suffer. I ceased studying a long time ago. Studying for a long time after not studying for months is hard, but I haven't studied for years, and I can't take my time. This time I am under pressure. Time forgives nothing, and that is the fairest trade in all of life.
- Today I configured Obsidian again. Since installing Arch, I haven't attended to the things I should have installed from the beginning. Today I wanted to study, but had little or nothing ready.  However, it will be easier next time because I understand what I'm doing and why.
